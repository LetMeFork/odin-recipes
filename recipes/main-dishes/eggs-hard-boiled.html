        <ul>
            <li>Medium pot.</li>
            <li>Medium bowl.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Large eggs.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Farm-fresh eggs are more difficult to peel than older eggs. If you want to make perfect hard boiled eggs, it pays to buy them in advance and cook them after a few days in the fridge.</li>
                <li>In order for the yolks to land right in the center of the hard boiled eggs, store the raw eggs upside down before you cook them.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </details>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Place eggs in a medium pot</strong> and cover with cold water by 1 inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring to a boil</strong>, then cover the pot and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the eggs cook</strong>, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes, depending on your desired done-ness (see <a href="https://cdn.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hard-boiled-eggs-970x1024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo</a>).</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The <em>10-minute eggs</em> will have vibrant, creamy yolks.</li>
            <li>The <em>12-minute eggs</em> will have paler and opaque yolks, with a chalkier texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water</strong> and chill for at least 14 minutes. This makes the eggs easier to peel.</li>
        <li><strong>Peel and enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The ice bath should set you up for success here, but that doesn’t mean the shell will all come off in one piece. Gently rap the egg on the counter to break the entire shell into small pieces. Carefully peel it away along the fractures, leaving the egg whites as intact as possible.</p>

    <h2>Store</h2>
    <p>If you’re not planning to eat the eggs right away, feel free to leave them in the shells and store them in the fridge. But even if this is the case, don’t cut the ice bath short! It’s crucial for stopping the cooking process and making the eggs easy to peel later on.</p>
    <p>Peeled or unpeeled hard boiled eggs will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>
