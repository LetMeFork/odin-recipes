    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelmeni are Russian tiny meat-filled dumplings. Making them by hand with parents is a classic family pastime during the cold and dark winter evenings for many East Slavs. Or, at least, it used to be.</p>
    <p>These dumplings are a common convenience food. Large batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on demand.</p>

            </ul>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped.</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons ice-cold water.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt.</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul> 
    </details>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make dough:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup.</li>
            <li>Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can make the dough in a Kitchen Aid; mix until the dough begins to form a ball.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Meanwhile, make filling:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're not a fan of raw onion, you can sauté the onion in butter over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes before using it in the filling.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You can make the meat filling by processing the filling ingredients through a meat grinder. Only use a blender or food processor if you have a special setting for meat.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Dust a baking sheet lightly</strong> with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the dumplings:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out.</li>
            <li>Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.</li>
            <li>Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle.</li>
            <li>Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together.</li>
            <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
            <li>Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>Cook them:</strong></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking for 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to fry</h2>
    <p>Melt butter or bacon grease in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté frozen pelmeni in hot butter until soft and meat is cooked through, just like a pierogi.</p>
