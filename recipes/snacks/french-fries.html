    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Ingredients</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>10 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed. Calculate about 2 large Russet potatoes per person.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Since they’re dense, they don’t contain as much water inside, which allows them to get extra crispy.</li>
                <li>Waxy potatoes are the worst. These include red potatoes, fingerling, and new potatoes. They’re high in moisture, and will actually become hollow when fried as the water evaporates out.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Salt.</li>
            <li>Ketchup or fry sauce (<i>optional</i>).</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Equipment</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Knife / French Fry Cutter / anything else for slicing potatoes.</li>
            <li>Paper towels.</li>
            <li>Plate.</li>
            <li>Deep fryer / Dutch oven.</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Want to know the secret on how to make French fries super crispy? <strong>Get rid of the starch</strong> by <em>soaking the potatoes in cold water</em> and <strong>remove moisture</strong> by <em>cooking them twice</em>!</p>
    <h3>Preparations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Slice the potatoes</strong> into ½ inch thick sticks. Using a French fry cutter makes this much easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the potato slices in cold water</strong> for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight (the longer, the crispier the fries). Store them in the fridge while they soak.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse the fries twice</strong> with cold water.</li>
        <li><strong>Lay the fries</strong> on paper towels and <strong>pat them</strong> completely dry.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then choose your cooking method: baking or frying.</p>

    <h3>Method 1: Baking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Toss with up to 1/2 cup vegetable oil</strong> and <strong>sprinkle with salt</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Place the fries</strong> in a single layer on a baking sheet at <em>400° F / 200° C</em> in the lower-third of the oven for <em>15-20 minutes</em>.</li>
        <li>Remove, toss, place in a single layer, and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes</strong> or <em>until brown and crispy</em>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Method 2: Frying</h3>
    <p>First round:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat oil</strong> in a deep fryer or dutch oven to <strong>300° F / 150° C</strong>.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This allows the middle of the potato to cook.</li>
            <li>You’ll need to fry in about <em>six batches</em>, so begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Add the potatoes to the oil</strong> with a slotted spoon and <strong>fry for about 5-6 minutes</strong>. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The oil should bubble lightly. We’re only heating the potatoes, we don’t want them to crisp yet.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Place the cooked potatoes</strong> on a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the rest of the remaining batches.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Second round:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Increase the heat to 400° F / 200° C</strong>.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This allows the outside to become crispy and golden.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Fry each batch</strong> a second time until they are <em>crisp and golden-brown</em>, about 5 minutes or so.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove them and place</strong> on dry paper towels. <strong>Sprinkle with salt</strong> as soon as they come out.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve with ketchup or fry sauce and enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Store and Reheat</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Let any leftover fries <strong>cool completely</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Store them in a Freezer bag</strong> in the fridge, removing <em>as much air from the bag as possible</em>.</li>
        <li>To reheat, <strong>bake at 350° F / 175° C</strong> for <em>about 10 minutes</em>. They reheat very well.</li>
    </ul>
