        <ul>
            <li>2.5 gallons or 10 qt of water.</li>
            <li>1 lb or 9 slices of classic black, dark or rye bread.</li>
            <li>1 handful of raisins.</li>
            <li>1.8 lb (4 cups) of sugar.</li>

            <li>3 large plastic soda bottles.</li>
        </ul> 
    </details>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Day 1</h3>
    <p>Best if prepared in the evening:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fill giant stock pot</strong> with 2.5 gallons of water (or divide it into two large pots) and <strong>bring to a boil</strong>.</li>
        <li>While waiting, <strong>toast the bread slices</strong> twice on the darkest toaster setting.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Darker bread makes darker kvas.</li>
            <li>Toast bread either outside or in your garage or your house will get smokey.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When water starts to boil, <strong>remove the pot from heat</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a handful of raisins and toasted bread to the pot</strong>, cover with the lid and let it stay overnight or at least <em>8 hours</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Day 2</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully <strong>remove toasted bread</strong> and discard it.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, <strong>mix together 4 cups of sugar and 1.5 Tbsp of yeast</strong>, add them to kvas mixture and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover with plastic wrap or lid</strong> and leave the mixture on the counter for another <em>6 hours</em>, stirring every couple hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Discard floating raisins</strong> by scooping them up with a large spoon.</li>
        <li>Using strainer or cheese cloth, <strong>pour kvas into bottles</strong>, loosely cover with lid and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following day once the bottles are completely chilled, you can tighten the lid.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>This kvas lasts up to a week in the fridge (probably longer, but it might start tasting kinda strong). You’ll notice it loses sweetness daily as it stands.</p>
    <p>Make sure to release the pressure from the bottles 1-2 times a day if an overinflating makes you nervous.</p>
    <p>kvas only has up to 1% alcohol content (still probably not recommended for pregos). The longer it sits in the fridge, the more slightly “alcoholic” it gets, but it’s still considered non-alcoholic. I think it’s best after a full day in the fridge.</p>
