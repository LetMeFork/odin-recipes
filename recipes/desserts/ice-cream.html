    <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <summary>Equipment</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice Cream Maker.</li>
            <li>Heatproof Bowl (<i>of your ice cream maker</i>).</li>
            <li>Medium Saucepan.</li>
            <li>Cup.</li>
            <li>Teaspoon.</li>
            <li>Spatula.</li>
            <li>Quart-size Airtight Container (<i>for optional step 5 and storage</i>).</li>
            <li>Piece of plastic wrap or foil (<i>for storage, optional</i>).</li>

        <summary>Ingredients</summary>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1½ cups heavy cream</b> - It creates the rich ice cream base.</li>
            <li><b>1½ cups whole milk</b> - I don’t recommend replacing it with reduced fat or skim. Whole milk’s higher fat content ensures that the homemade ice cream comes out creamy, not icy.</li>
            <li><b>⅔ cup cane sugar</b> - For sweetness.</li>
            <li><b>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</b> - For warm vanilla flavor.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Vanilla bean paste</b> - It’s a fun alternative. It gives the ice cream the same rich vanilla flavor, plus a speckled vanilla bean appearance.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>⅛ teaspoon salt</b> – To make all the flavors pop!</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Some homemade ice cream recipes call for <b>eggs</b> or <b>egg yolks</b> to make the ice cream richer or thicker. I don’t use them here because leaving them out makes this recipe ultra-simple to prepare. And for my money, it’s just as delicious as one with a custard base!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>At least 12 hours before you want to make homemade ice cream</em>, <b>freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker.</b> It needs to be fully chilled in order for the ice cream to firm up.</li>
        <li><b>Make the ice cream base.</b> <em>I recommend doing this step anywhere from 2 to 24 hours in advance.</em> If you do it less than 2 hours ahead, the ice cream won’t thicken as nicely when you churn it.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt.</li>
            <li>Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Chill the ice cream base:</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour into the heatproof bowl.</li>
            <li>Cover.</li>
            <li>Chill for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Churn it:</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well.</li>
            <li>Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be <em>soft</em> after churning.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>For <em>firmer</em> ice cream, <b>transfer to an airtight container</b> and <b>freeze for 2 to 4 hours</b> before serving. Then, it’s perfectly scoopable.</li>
    </ol>

        <summary>Toppings & Variations</summary>
        <p>This vanilla ice cream is wonderful plain, but toppings certainly don’t hurt! Here are a few topping ideas to get you started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Try something fruity</b>, like strawberry compote, blueberry compote, or your favorite fresh fruit. Diced bananas, blueberries, and cherries would all be good choices.</li>
            <li><b>Go nuts</b>. Drizzle on peanut butter or almond butter, or sprinkle on toasted almonds or peanuts. Shredded coconut is a yummy topping too!</li>
            <li><b>Choose chocolate</b>. Chocolate chips are always a great option, but crumbled chocolate chip cookies or brownie chunks make for a next-level sundae.</li>
            <li><b>Keep it classic</b>. You can never go wrong with salted caramel sauce, hot fudge, and/or whipped cream.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Not feeling plain old vanilla?</b> To make a different ice cream flavor, fold 2 to 2 1/2 cups of finely diced mix-ins into the ice cream immediately after churning. Adding fresh strawberries makes a wonderful strawberry ice cream, but another fresh fruit, mini chocolate chips, or cookie or brownie crumbles would be great too.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Use a spatula to transfer the soft ice cream from the ice cream maker into the quart-size airtight container. If you like, press a piece of plastic wrap or foil into the top of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals from forming.</p>
    <p>Freeze for at least 2 hours and for up to a month. It gets firmer after more time in the freezer. If the ice cream is too firm to scoop, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften.</p>
